# GitHub repo is located at https://github.com/IBM/openwhisk-cloudant-trigger
# Installing openwhisk actions, triggers, and rules for OpenWhisk building block - Cloudant Trigger

# Deployment using this manifest file creates following OpenWhisk components:
#   Package:    openwhisk-cloudant
#   Package:    $PACKAGE_NAME
#   Action:     $PACKAGE_NAME/process-change.js
#   Sequence:   $PACKAGE_NAME/process-change-cloudant-sequence
#   Trigger:    $TRIGGER_NAME
#   Rule:       $RULE_NAME

# This manifest file reads following env. variables:
